In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a variety of functions that would "maximize" a flow network which is essentially a weighted graph. 

P1,P2, P3 are the expected outputs from our function

adjMatrix.c is the code that utilizes trees and defines the functions that will be manipulating any adjacency matricies

linkedQueue.c has all the functions used with queues that can be called in main, assignment3.c

assignment3.c manipulates the flow network through the adjacency matrix to maximize the given weighted graph. It utlized a breadth first path search to find the path to input any "flow" and did so until there were no paths available.
