# C-Labs
As a part of my second programming course, CSC190 - Data Strucures and Algorithms, we learned various data structures (Linked 
Lists, Queues, Stacks, Heaps, Graphs/Trees, Hash Tables...), and some algorithms (BFS, DFS...) while learning to code in
C. As a part of this lab, we were given 9 minor assignments and 3 major assignments that tested our abilities to apply our 
knowledge.

In this repository, you will find all of the code that I had written for this course and it's assignments. 


I took CSC190 in my first year, second semester from January-April 2015.

Througout the course, my mark was approximately 92-94%, but due to a high class average, I was adjusted to a final mark of 84%
I was pretty pissed at that 1%.
